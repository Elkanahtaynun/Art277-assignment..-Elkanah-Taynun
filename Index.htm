<b>What is Lorem Ipsum?</b>
</h1>
<p> <i> </i>
<b>Lorem Ipsum </b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software li ke <U> <b>Aldus Page Maker </b> </u> including versions of <U> Lorem Ipsum </U>. 1914 translation by H. Rackham 
<br> <br>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoid pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of life, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.

 Why do we use it? 

<p> 
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using <u> Lorem Ipsum </u> is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using “ content here, content here” ,
